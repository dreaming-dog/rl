Implementation of DQN, n-step DQN and TreeQN. Tested on Cartpole and various Atari. 
Reproduces results in TreeQN and fixes a [subtle bug](https://github.com/oxwhirl/treeqn/issues/3) in the authors' implementation
Contains the code for an abandoned project. 
Important feature: Modular code for easy addition of custom losses (such state prediction loss, reward loss, etc).
TODO: clean up some code, refactor models for readbility.
